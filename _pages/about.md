# üëã About Me

My name is Henryk Chan(Haolin Chen), and I am a passionate researcher and medical engineering innovator dedicated to advancing healthcare through cutting-edge biomedical technologies. My academic background includes a degree in engineering and a current master‚Äôs program, both accredited by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). My research interests focus on wearable electrochemical (bio)sensors, biosensors for wound management, and ECG systems utilizing liquid metal technology.

I have a strong track record in research, with a few peer-reviewed publications in high-impact SCI Q1 journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SCHOLAR_ID&user=Yu9lHQgAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Additionally, I hold a certified patent for a novel medical device, reflecting my commitment to translating research into practical applications. These accomplishments highlight my dedication to developing innovative solutions that address real-world healthcare challenges.

Beyond my academic and research achievements, I am actively involved in interdisciplinary collaborations as a member of the Advanced Hackspace team, where I contribute to exploring creative engineering solutions. I also serve as a Responder Volunteer at Hammersmith Hospital, part of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, where I support the healthcare team in enhancing patient care.
